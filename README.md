# DiscordBot

The Team Bot is designed to help servers that host competitive lobbies where a group will
split into two teams and play against each other. It will provide several different options
for splitting up a team, including polls for self selection, team captains, or randomly
assigning all members. There will also be options for having different amounts of teams, or
having a spectator.
