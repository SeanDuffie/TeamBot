# DiscordBot
Starting code for a discord bot. Can be repurposed for other projects later. I will include extensive documentation so the end user knows how everything works.

## Discord Setup

    1. Go to the following link, then sign into your Discord account
        - https://discord.com/developers/applications/
    2. Afterwards, select "New Application", enter the name of your new bot, and "Create"
    3. Here you can personalize the bot by adding a name, description, picture, and tags
    4. Take note of your application token, then insert it into the code.
    5. Invite your bot to the server, and give it the proper permissions.
    6. Run the code
